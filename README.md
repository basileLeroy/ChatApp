An amazing tool to build a chat application. Instead of going trough the trouble of making a complete `socket.io` from scratch, this tool will give you a complete framework, customizable to your own needs.   
It goes from the simplest 15 lines of code and you are done, to a complete rework of the features and styling.   
   
It is still quite new and finding documentation outside their website might prove a challenge, but from personal experience, Adam (the author) is quite reachable and ready to hear your questions!
